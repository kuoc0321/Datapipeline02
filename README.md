# Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline with Apache Flink, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Docker  

Real-time data streaming pipelines are critical for processing and analyzing continuous streams of data. This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline that ingests, processes, and stores data in real time using industry-standard technologies like **Apache Flink**, **Kafka**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**.  

By implementing this pipeline, businesses can:  

- **Streamline Data Processing**: Handle high-velocity data streams efficiently.  
- **Gain Real-Time Insights**: Process and analyze data with minimal latency.  
- **Ensure Scalability and Reliability**: Use robust, fault-tolerant architectures.  

## Key Features  

1. **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Use **Apache Kafka** to capture and publish high-throughput data streams.  
2. **Stream Processing**: Leverage **Apache Flink** for real-time transformations, filtering, and aggregations.  
3. **Data Persistence**: Store processed data in a **PostgreSQL** database for analytics and reporting.  
4. **Containerized Deployment**: Use **Docker** to simplify deployment and ensure consistent environments.
